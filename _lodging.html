    <h2>Lodging at Copper Mountain</h2>

    <p>
    A typical lodge room has one or two queen beds, and a two-bedroom condominium has
    one or two queen beds in each bedroom, two baths, a kitchen, a dining area,
    and fireplace. Please be sure to verify the number of beds and the layout when
    making reservations.
    </p>

    <h4>Per night rates (as of Spring 2016) are as follows</h4>
    <pre>
        {% for d in info.rates -%}
        {% set dd = d.popitem() %}
        {{ dd[0] }}: {{ dd[1] }}
        {%- endfor %}
    </pre>

    <p> Make your room reservation directly with Copper Mountain on or before
    <b>{{ deadlines.lodging.date }}</b>.
    Availability of rooms cannot be guaranteed after this date.
    Copper Mountain reserves the right to release part of the conference
    room block if 50% of the block is not reserved by this date.  After this date,
    all remaining unreserved rooms in the conference block will be released.
    In previous years, we have indeed run out of rooms, so please reserve your rooms
    as soon as possible.  </p>

    <p> State and local taxes (13.30%) will be added to the cost of the room.
    If available, group rates can be applied to stays two days before and after the
    conference. Identify yourself with the {{info.year}} Conference Group code
    <b>{{info.groupcode}}</b> to get group rates.</p>

    <h4>Individual Lodging Deposit Policy</h4>

    balance on the room reservation will be billed to the credit card number on
    file 21 days prior to arrival.</p>

    <p>For individual attendees who cancel their lodging reservations, the following will be in effect:

      <li>If cancelled less than 21 days prior to arrival date, the individual is subject to full forfeiture of the reservation value.</li>
