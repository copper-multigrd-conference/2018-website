    <h4>Conference Format</h4>

    <p>
    The conference typically features morning and afternoon sessions consisting
    of individual talks of approximately 25 minutes each, including time for
    questions.  In addition, special topics workshops and tutorials are often
    held during afternoon mid-day breaks.  More details can be found below and on
    the <a href="{{info.programlink}}">program</a> page.
    </p>

    <p>
    A <a href="student.html#details">student paper competition</a> is open to
    current and recent students attending the conference.  In addition, a
    <a href="about.html#specialissue">special issue</a> devoted to the themes of
    the conference is open to all.
    </p>

    <h4 id="specialissue">SIAM SISC special issue devoted to iterative methods</h4>
    <p>
<br/> <br/> <br/> 
special issue editor-in-chief: Irad Yavneh <br/>
Submission deadline: To be Determined.
<br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/>
</p>
<!--
     As in previous odd-numbered years, a Special Section of Numerical Linear
     Algebra with Applications is planned. This single issue will be dedicated
     to recent progress in multigrid methods. Submissions are encouraged in all
     aspects of multigrid methods, including this year's highlighted <a href="about.html#topics">topics</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
      Attendees and participants of the conference as well as the general community
      are invited to submit papers. The papers should meet the formatting and
      editorial requirements of Numerical Linear Algebra with Applications.
    </p>

    <p>
    Submissions for the special issue will be accepted from {{
    deadlines.specialissueopen.date }} until <b>{{ deadlines.specialissue.date
    }}</b>.  Papers will be subject to review by a guest Editorial Board.
    </p>

    <p>
      Submissions should be made using the ordinary submission process
      <a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/journal/10.1002/(ISSN)1099-1506">Numerical Linear Algebra with Applications</a>
      with a statement in the cover letter requesting that the paper be considered for the
      Special Issue on Multigrid Methods.
