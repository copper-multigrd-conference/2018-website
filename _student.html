      <h4>Student Paper Competition</h4>
      <p>
      Any student or new Ph.D. whose degree was awarded after Jan 1, {{info.year-1}}
      is invited to submit a paper to the Student Paper Competition.
      Submissions should be based on work while done as a full-time student;
      results after graduation are not eligible.  In addition, all papers
      submitted should represent the work and writing of the student submitting
      the paper, developed in collaboration with any named
      advisors/collaborators.  Proofreading and editing by senior contributors
      is allowed, but contributions must be written primarily by the student
      author.

      Student papers must be formatted according to the template provided (below), with no
      changes in margins, font sizes, etc.  Contributions may be at most 10 pages
      long, including all figures and references.  Papers submitted that do not
      follow these requirements will not be considered for the competition.
      </p>

      submission can befound in the README.
